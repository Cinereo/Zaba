# Zaba

Piece of legacy code, project for Software Engineering course.
I was tasked to solve inconsistencies in process of listening for syntax to correct and to solve the massice resource hog problem as well as atrocious startup time.
Secondary goal is a Firefox Quantum port.

Designed to correct polish syntax, but after some tweaks should be able to pull of just about any Latin-alphabet-language.
